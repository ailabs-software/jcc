# jcc
Minimal required code to transpile Java to ECMAScript.

jcc input.java > output.class (JS bytecode)

MISSION: The minimum subset of GWT to transpile. No library.

ROADMAP:
1. Get minimum compiler working
2. Figure out which classes are really needed, and eliminate everything else so gwt becomes subgwt
